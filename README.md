## Introduction

Bitcoin, a highly volatile cryptocurrency, has gained immense popularity over the past few years. Predicting its price is challenging, but machine learning models can be leveraged to analyze patterns and provide useful forecasts. This project uses historical Bitcoin prices and machine learning models to predict future values, presenting them via an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## Features

- **Historical Data Visualization**: Displays interactive graphs showing historical trends in Bitcoin prices.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Employs machine learning models to predict future Bitcoin prices.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use UI created with Streamlit.
- **Live Data Integration**: Fetches real-time Bitcoin data to keep the model up to date (if applicable).

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SAIKUMAR039/bit-coin-prediction-stramlit.git
    cd bit-coin-prediction-stramlit
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

The application will start on a local development server, and you can access it at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:8501`.
2. Interact with the interface to visualize historical Bitcoin data and predict future prices.
3. Adjust parameters (if applicable) to fine-tune the predictions.

## Data Source

The historical Bitcoin price data can be fetched from any reliable API, such as [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) or [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/cryptocurrencies/). Ensure you have the appropriate API credentials (if needed) and implement the API calls within the app for live data integration.

## Modeling Techniques

The application uses a variety of machine learning models to predict future prices of Bitcoin. The models may include:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks)**

Depending on the project's scope, these models could be trained on past Bitcoin price data and then applied to predict future values.

## Future Work

- Improve prediction accuracy by experimenting with more advanced models like ARIMA or Prophet.
- Integrate live Bitcoin data for more real-time predictions.
- Enhance UI for better user experience.
- Deploy the app to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS for public access.
